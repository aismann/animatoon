# Animatoon

(Made in Purebasic)

Animatoon is a 2D painting program (and later, I hope to add animation).
This program is open-source (licence GPLv3)

Made by blendman (Since 2011, 2012-2015, 2017, 2021), with the help of a lot of people :) (purebasic forums french, english and german)

Contributions and help : 
Kernadec, Dobro, Attomo, G-rom, Le Soldat Inconnu (LSI), Kwandjeen, Djes, Falsam, Typhoon, Guillot, Netmaestro, Danillo, Rashad, Wilbert, Onilink, Marc256, and probably a lot of others users of purebasic I have forgotten (sorry)...


You can use it, modify it, but please provide the new sources and don't forget my name Blendman ;).


Thanks.
